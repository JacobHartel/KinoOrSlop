# KINO OR SLOP
## This was just a quick project for some friends

I grabbed some massive json files from Kaggle. 
These stored millions of tweets. Completely random.

This idea sprung from a little trend on twitter. People were calling things
either kino (good) or slop (bad).

The original idea was to scrape new and relevent tweets but that proved to be 
too difficult or too expensive. So I just did this. 

If I ever get a cheap and efficient way to scrape current tweets I would likely
add a score parameter to the json file so we could rank how good a tweet is. 

That could then be used for training a model (or fine tuning) to create a tweet-banger-bot.


The .json file is too big for my hosting plan (lol) but it works for now.
